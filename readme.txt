A plugin that shows a popup containing code that links to your site when somebody right-clicks an image in your article.

== Description ==

This plugin will help put all those hot-linked images to good use. A hotlinked image can be a bit of a drain on your website's bandwidth because everytime the image is viewed on another website, it is being downloaded from your host.

Once you've enabled this plugin and set your options, anybody who right-clicks on an image will receive a pop-up "dialog box" asking them to use the code for linking to the image from a normal website, or for use in forums.

This plugin is based on the javascript widget [LinkMyPics](http://www.funscripts.net/javascript-widgets/)
